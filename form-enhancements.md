## Implementation Details

All enhancements maintain the CSS-first approach, with minimal JavaScript only where necessary for enhanced functionality (like range slider value display). The design uses the framework's established variables for golden ratio spacing, colors, and glassmorphism effects.

The form controls are fully responsive, with optimized layouts and touch targets for mobile devices.

## Browser Compatibility

Special attention was paid to browser compatibility issues:
- Added vendor prefixes for appearance properties
- Ensured consistent styling across modern browsers
- Tested with various input types and states

## Future Enhancements Roadmap

- Form validation API integration
- Accessible form patterns
- More input types (date pickers, color selectors)
- Custom file upload controls
